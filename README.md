File Metadata Microservice
=================
A file metadata microservice.

User Stories:

1. I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.
2. The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

Built using: NodeJS, Bootstrap v4.
